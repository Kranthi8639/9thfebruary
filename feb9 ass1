#Program to find the greatest among two number using operators    

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))  

b = int(input("Enter second number: "))   

#Compare both the number 

 if(a - b > 0): 

 print("a is larger than b") 

 else(b -a > 0):     

 print("b is larger than a) 

 else:

      print("Both numbers are Equal")

Output:

a= 9

b=7

9 is larger than 7
